Invested way too much into this. 
It reads csv files now, pretty lit.
for some ungodly reason, i can only seat and print the seating of 92 attendees before it crashes due to nullpointer exception
I'm not fixing it Jeremy can do that one.
Table class had the right idea just used a lot of incorrect variable names/incorrect syntax.
Before the fix it would just duplicate the same attendee into every table/seat.
Mine doesn't do that. 
I didn't comment half the stuff i was doing but deal with it, you got free labor.
