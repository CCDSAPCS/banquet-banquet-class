This is my supercalifragilisticespialodocious version of banquet class.
It is fully abstracted. just run Banquet.java and input the requested values.
I've made changes here and there on every class for readability.
-Had to fix the table class for it to work, syntax errors and incorrect variable names. 
-Added a bunch of one line methods to return values and print stuff.
